You can configure some "Learn More" links that are shown in some steps (screenshare, whiteboard, general) in the settings of the plugin, see example below.

## Running the Plugin From Source Code

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

2. Add this to the `settings.yml` of the BBB HTML5-client:
```yaml
public:
  plugins:
    - name: TourPlugin
      url: <<PLUGIN_URL>>
      settings:
        url:
          screenshare: "https://some.url.with.more.information"
          whiteboard: "https://some.url.with.more.information"
          general: "https://some.url.with.more.information"
```

## Building the Plugin

To build the plugin for production use, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install
npm run build-bundle
```

The above command will generate the `dist` folder, containing the bundled JavaScript file named `TourPlugin.js`. This file can be hosted on any HTTPS server.

Alternatively, you can host the bundled file on the BigBlueButton server by copying dist/TourPlugin.js to the folder /var/www/bigbluebutton-default/assets/plugins. In this case, the <<PLUGIN_URL>> will be https://<your-host>/plugins/QuestionsPlugin.js.
